testnet. The Minebux foundation&rsquo;s primary goal is to create a cryptocurrency that is fully integrated into the game Minecraft. Enjin is a token that has the same goal, however, I believe the way they are operating is not considering the target market of those who play minecraft. Minebux aims to integrate real world money market principles into in-game mechanics. Adding smart contracts for options (call contracts, put contracts), Swaps (acting as a medium of insurance for items that have no perceived value) and commodity contracts. Minebux uses market principles by creating a market for items and tokens to drive the in-game economy for each Minecraft Server. Any server can use the token for free, however, to actually be successful in using the token, there will have to be a value proposition and rarity artificially dictated by the server itself. </span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c21 c8 c19">Keywords:<br></span><span class="c10 c8">Decentralized currency, cryptocurrency, ERC-1155 token, ERC-777 token, smart contract, NFT, Minecraft, Minecraft Server </span></p><p class="c30"><span class="c21 c8 c19">1.Introduction</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c8">Minebux</span><span class="c10 c8">&nbsp;is an ERC-777 standard ethererum-backed token powered by the Rinkeby testnet. To make Minebux feeless it utilizes the Rinkeby testnet. Since Minebux is not backed by main net ethereum, it has no perceived value. What gives Minebux value is artificial. Minebux&rsquo;s rarity and in direct contrast ease to be obtained by anyone drives the community and perceived value of the token. Minebux plans to print 100 quadrillion tokens. Out of which; a percentage will be: burned, given in compensation to the development team, pooled for rewards, added to a grant to encourage servers to participate in Minebux, saved for a future presale, added to an initial trading liquidity pool, and for marketing. </span></p><p class="c7 c13"><span class="c10 c8"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c21 c8 c19">2.Background</span><span class="c17 c8">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5">2.1 Why the name Minebux? </span></p><p class="c7 c55"><span class="c8">To really drive home the point of what the product is.

To help players instantly understand what Minebux are, and have a vision of how they can be used. </span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c16 c19">2.2 Why develop </span><span class="c16 c19">Minebux</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;with competition? </span></p><p class="c7 c26"><span class="c8">Minebux</span><span class="c10 c8">&nbsp;is not the first Minecraft integrated token/coin, meaning Minebux will be conceived in a red ocean. Enjin in partnership with Microsoft (who own Minecraft) have created EnjinCraft which is an ongoing project for many years in which they have added NFTs and their own ERC-1155 token to the game. The reason to compete with such a significant force is because we believe we can beat Microsoft at their own game (quite literally). The way enjin is integrated makes enjin unappealing to server owners, NFTs extremely unworthwhile to the end user and doesn&rsquo;t utilize market like mechanics for their currency. Using these disadvantages against Enjin creates a blue ocean for Minebux to take market share and influence to steer the community forward as a whole.</span></p><p class="c7 c26"><span class="c5">2.3 What fundamentally makes the Minebux foundation different from Enjin? </span></p><p class="c7 c47"><span class="c10 c8">Enjin is focused on treating Minecraft itself like one game, while Minebux whos&rsquo; developer backgrounds include creating Minecraft servers understand that every Minecraft server is unique. Minecraft servers should be treated all as individual games and or experiences. The Minebux foundation focuses on server owner self regulation, meaning the NFTs they make are not backed by Minebux by default, instead are backed by the server&rsquo;s individual currency, this is to encourage more server owners to use Minebux and create a more inviting community for smaller server owners to be able to adopt Minebux as part of their server ecosystem.</span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c5">2.4 What are swaps? </span></p><p class="c34"><span class="c10 c8">Players who would like to back their items in Minebux could pay another player premiums for that specific item over time to insure that item retains value even if the price of the underlying asset is to plummet beneath the price of that item now. </span></p><p class="c34 c13"><span class="c10 c8"></span></p><p class="c34"><span class="c5">2.5 Why use swaps?</span></p><p class="c34"><span class="c10 c8">Swaps were created to swap risk between players to give NFTs value even if the server is no longer available. It is optional because we wanted the ecosystem to be easy to use without server owners having to take the burden of having to pay Minebux per item minted.</span></p><p class="c13 c34"><span class="c17 c8"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16 c19">2.6 How do players acquire Minebux?</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c10 c8">Minebux themselves can be acquired by players through exchanging Banano for them. Exchanging to the Liquidity Pool maintained by the Minebux Foundation and the community wanting to buy Minebux using Banano. When reached on the roadmap, buying Minebux&rsquo;s sister token on the ethereum main net (which will not be feeless) will be able to be exchanged one to one for Minebux on the Rinkeby testnet. They can also be tipped from other players in the community, distributed by server owners, received via airdrops, giveaways, and events.</span></p><p class="c7 c13"><span class="c10 c8"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c14">Please Note: Any tokens on the main net until then are not related to Minebux. Any official news will be announced on the Minebux Foundation website</span></p><p class="c7 c13"><span class="c14"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5">2.7 Why Banano?</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c10 c8">Banano shares the same ideals of feeless currency and friendly community first mindsets. To integrate a fork of Banano directly was considered however was deemed too expensive and resource intensive. In a compromise with the development team not being spread out too thin, a Rinkeby token solution was discussed and collaborated on.</span></p><p class="c7 c13"><span class="c10 c8"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c21 c8 c19 c24">3.Minebux design philosophy</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5">3.1 Strategic Design</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c10 c8">Michael Porter talks about competitive advantage which is a way to evaluate your current advantage to other companies. Apple&rsquo;s very own Kawasaki has a matrix to show how business can be categorized. It goes as follows.</span></p><p class="c7 c13"><span class="c10 c8"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c8">Fig 1. </span><span class="c11 c8">Kawasaki&rsquo;s matrix for market advantage</span></p><p class="c7"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 532.50px; height: 532.50px;"><img alt="" src="images/image2.jpg" style="width: 532.50px; height: 532.50px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c10 c8">We fully admit &ldquo;Faster, cheaper, better&rdquo; is only a temporary advantage, and you cannot build a sustainable market advantage on operational efficiency alone. Due to this we utilize business principles to guide the design philosophy of Minebux.</span></p><p class="c7 c13"><span class="c10 c8"></span></p><p class="c7 c12"><span class="c10 c16">Being Unique:</span></p><p class="c7 c12"><span class="c10 c8">Being unique and creating a value proposition for players helps Minebux cushion itself onto best Market fit. Minebux is designed to serve many needs of Many players in a narrow market. Our target market becomes economic entutists in Minecraft. The net effect of which is Minebux will continue to be faster, cheaper and better for perpetuity however, only for the target market.</span></p><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c10 c8"></span></p><p class="c7 c12"><span class="c10 c16">Making Trade-offs:</span></p><p class="c7 c12"><span class="c10 c8">In making Minebux a lot of trade-offs were made. The mindset behind this is that, &ldquo;Doing everything isn&rsquo;t strategy, it&rsquo;s indecision, we need to choose what not to do.&rdquo; In doing so a lot of the plans with Minebux had to be scrapped to keep Minebux the stable stool that it is.</span></p><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c10 c8"></span></p><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c10 c8"></span></p><p class="c7 c12"><span class="c8">Fig 2. </span><span class="c11 c8">Shows the legs of the stool which hold Minebux as a currency</span></p><p class="c7 c12"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 539.50px; height: 456.50px;"><img alt="" src="images/image5.jpg" style="width: 539.96px; height: 456.50px; margin-left: -0.23px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c10 c8"></span></p><p class="c7 c18"><span class="c2">Value</span></p><p class="c7 c18"><span class="c10 c8">Minebux was always planned to be free to use. This was on purpose to compete not just with Enjin, but with existing payment platforms for Minecraft. Servers have been using Buycraft for over a decade because it is free and easy to use with no barrier to entry. Competing with this directly in a fierce Red Ocean would be impossible. Minebux instead uses its efforts to use Market Principles and social gaming to create a new Blue Ocean for Minebux to conquer. The value of Minebux doesn&rsquo;t come from Minebux themselves as Minebux isn&rsquo;t a &ldquo;play to earn&rdquo; model. However, the legs of the stool create the value for the target Market of this product. Minebux is purposefully built to be used by everyone and be fun for all players. We don&rsquo;t want to create an environment that allows for players to use more &nbsp;money than they can afford. </span></p><p class="c7 c18 c13"><span class="c10 c8"></span></p><p class="c7 c18"><span class="c10 c8">Being mindful that exploitative behavior may occur in individual servers, Minebux does not plan to regulate how servers act and treat players. We believe that the free market will decide the fate of servers and players themselves will be able to decide financially what servers to play on and servers to avoid and let die. Using financial incentive as a democratic vote allows for mass amounts of players to dictate the fate of a server in the ecosystem whilst being able to participate equally to the amount of Minebux they own, the sustainability of a server currency.</span></p><p class="c7 c18 c13"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7 c18"><span class="c2">Market Principles</span></p><p class="c7 c18"><span class="c10 c8">Utilizing Market Principles helps attract our target market of economic enthusiasts in Minecraft. Baked into the system and add-ons are tools and utilities that creates a community that is very niche with all of the features it meets many of their needs. This adds value to the overall project because it helps Minebux focus on the target Market and also creates a value proposition for novice economists who see Minebux as a small risk entrance into the overall community and advanced economists who already understand the risks and overall market movement. Minebux mitigates players from spending more money than they can afford to spend.</span></p><p class="c7 c18 c13"><span class="c10 c8"></span></p><p class="c7 c18"><span class="c2">Social Gaming</span></p><p class="c7 c18"><span class="c10 c8">According to Bartle&rsquo;s theories one out of four ways players interact with most games and their systems include social games. Social gamers are a majority of the market and play a humongous role in trading. Social gaming in Minebux is highly encouraged creating miniature ecosystems in Minecraft servers itself. In the Minebux Minecraft client it is planned among other features a ingame proximity chat. </span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c21 c8 c19">4</span><span class="c21 c8 c19">.Contracts<br></span><span class="c5">4.1 ERC-777 token (Minebux)</span></p><p class="c7 c52"><span class="c10 c8">ERC-777 Standard is a fungible token standard which aims to fix a lot of the problems of ERC-20 and ERC-223. Minebux uses ERC-777 as its main currency facilitating trades between server-created ERC-1155 tokens. The ERC-777 token used will be a slightly modified version of OpenZeppelin&rsquo;s ERC-777 standard. </span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c16 c19">4.2 ERC-1155 token</span><span class="c24 c16 c53">&nbsp;(Server currencies, NFT, LFT)</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c10 c8">ERC-1155 Standard was created by Enjin and is used to create both fungible and non-fungible tokens in one contract. The ERC-1155 token used will be a slightly modified version of OpenZeppelin&rsquo;s ERC-1155 standard. </span></p><p class="c3 c13"><span class="c10 c8"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5">4.3 Membership / Rank contract</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c17 c8">Membership and Ranks have to be created by two parties, locking Minebux into the contract until used, which will grant the user what the rank / member contract permissions promised. The locked Minebux will be released once the contract is used, 90% of which will go to the creator, 5% will be burned and 5% of which is taxed.</span></p><p class="c3 c13"><span class="c17 c8"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c27 c8 c19">TODO other contracts</span></p><p class="c3 c13"><span class="c10 c8"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c21 c8 c19">5</span><span class="c24 c21 c8 c19">. Minebux Components</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5">5.1 Basic Minebux components</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c8 c19">Minebux is on the Rinkeby network meaning traditional ICO protocol will not be followed when accounting for Presale and Liquidy. </span><span class="c8">However, when The Minebux Foundation creates a bridge for the main net token, Presale and Liquidity rules are subject to change to follow a more traditional ICO.</span></p><p class="c3 c13"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5">5.1a Presale</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c10 c8">There will be no presale of Minebux because Minebux will be on the Rinkeby network and will not need Liquidity for Liquidity Pools. However, a percentage of Minebux will be preserved for a future presale when Minebux&rsquo;s sister currency on the main net is created.</span></p><p class="c3 c13"><span class="c10 c8"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c16 c19">5.1b</span><span class="c8 c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c16 c19">Liquidity</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c10 c8">There will be no money raised for Liquidity Pools. However, in an effort to be in good standing with the community, the Minebux Foundation will provide liquidity via Bannao on the Minebux website. However, since Banano cannot be locked in Ethereum contracts, this will be on a trust basis. </span></p><p class="c3 c13"><span class="c10 c8"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c10 c8">The Minebux Foundation&rsquo;s liquidity comes from the exchanging of Minebux with Banano. Around 95% of it will be held in a wallet acting as a liquidity pool to ease investor concerns of a &ldquo;rugpull&rdquo;. With 5% being spent on marketing efforts.</span></p><p class="c3 c13"><span class="c10 c8"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5">5.1c Burning</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c8 c19">The sale</span><span class="c17 c8">&nbsp;of any asset in the Minecraft Server Ecosystem for Minebux will result in a burning of 2% of the Minebux in the transaction.</span></p><p class="c3 c13"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5">5.1d Tax</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c10 c8">The sale of any asset sold for Minebux will result in the 5% tax of Minebux from the seller.</span></p><p class="c3 c13"><span class="c10 c8"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5">5.2 Distribution, Holding and Destruction</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c10 c8">Distribution will mint 100 quadrillion tokens. Minebux will be capped at 100 quadrillion tokens and will not be able to mint more after the fact.</span></p><p class="c3 c13"><span class="c10 c8"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c8">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c10 c16">Burning:</span></p><p class="c3 c12"><span class="c10 c8">Minebux burns currency every transaction and burns a 10% share of Minebux overall minting over a period of 2% per year for a solid 5 year plan. The reason the burn rate and holding are relatively small is due to how Minebux is structured to be a highly transactable utility token. However, to quence investor and player fears we will still be burning tokens over time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10 c8"></span></p><p class="c3 c12"><span class="c10 c16">Development team compensation:</span></p><p class="c3 c12"><span class="c8">To keep developers onboard and enthusiastic about Minebux, 24.75% of the minted tokens will be held to compensate Minebux&rsquo;s development team now and in the future. How the token is distributed amongst the developers will be at the discretion of the development team themselves. </span></p><p class="c3 c13"><span class="c10 c16"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c10 c16">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rewards:</span></p><p class="c3 c12"><span class="c10 c8">Rewards help the development team reward long time holders and bug hunters. Those who can find bugs will be rewarded in Minebux on a case by case basis.</span></p><p class="c3 c13"><span class="c10 c16"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c10 c16">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Server Ecosystem Participation Grant:</span></p><p class="c3 c12"><span class="c10 c8">To help servers integrate into the Minebux community and the Minebux ecosystem, the Minebux Foundation will review, evaluate and distribute a portion of the 7.25% of allocated Minebux pool to candidates.</span></p><p class="c3 c13"><span class="c10 c16"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c10 c16">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marketing:</span></p><p class="c3 c12"><span class="c10 c8">To get Minebux in the general audience 15% of the minted tokens will be held for marketing efforts.

Out of the 15.5% held for this purpose, only around 10% will be available all at once. The remaining 5.5% of which will be held for an determined amount of time to be sold periodically in the open market to help stabilize Minebux. The goal of which is to mitigate a grash or too much upside at once. Acting as primitive circuit breakers. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10 c8"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c10 c16">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Future Presale:</span></p><p class="c3 c12"><span class="c10 c8">Minebux&rsquo;s sister token on the main net will have a presale to maintain and lock liquidity in liquidity pools. 14% of Minebux will be held until Minebux is added to the main net.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10 c8"></span></p><p class="c7 c12"><span class="c14">Please Note: Any tokens on the main net until then are not related to Minebux.

The open market is referred to frequently and because of such, we wanted to label it to be completely understood from player to player instantly. The open market was created for players to trade. However, the market was created as a part of the market principles section of Minebux and not expressly social gaming. Learning from the Market and social media combined platforms, trying to utilize the Market and social media combined platforms, trying to apply the market platform for social media is unsuccessful and as such Minebux relies on &lsquo;natural trade&rsquo; on servers, including servers specifically for trade. Trade servers in this sense is the social gaming glue which helps mold MInbux and not the open market itself.</span></p><p class="c3 c13"><span class="c10 c8"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5">6.2 The Exchange</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c10 c8">The Exchange is a &nbsp;platform which facilitates Exchanges from one server currency to another and to Minebux. Exchanging one currency for another is always a risk, a real world equivalent known as foreign exchange risk. However, Minebux has built a platform which integrates all server currencies into each other constructing a melting pot effect which will mitigate individual server inflation and have a democratic system using Minebux and other server currency as a way to vote to dictate currency demand, decreasing the use of less popular and useful currencies.</span></p><p class="c3 c13"><span class="c10 c8"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c16">Trade disparity to Minebux:</span></p><p class="c3 c12"><span class="c10 c8">Trades to Minebux are discouraged in high frequency for Server Owners to Players. </span></p><p class="c3 c12"><span class="c10 c8"><br>The thought process behind this decision was, server_currency should be more expensive to buy than it is worth to sell, and to reflect this the buy and sell menus do not affect the overall price of the server_currency.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10 c8"></span></p><p class="c3 c12"><span class="c10 c8">This is done to help the Minebux ecosystem stay stable and the Minebux Server Ecosystem participants stay independent. However, to keep server owners from swaying the exchange, and to better convince them to join the ecosystem to begin with, they will be encouraged to run sale of their server currency called Minebux ICO&rsquo;s</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10 c8"></span></p><p class="c3 c12"><span class="c10 c8">In addition, they will be encouraged to maintain Liquidity Pools with Minebux, which can be locked in smart contracts on the Exchange, this will raise the trust factor of their server on the server list.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10 c8"></span></p><p class="c3 c12"><span class="c10 c16">Banano and Minebux:</span></p><p class="c3 c12"><span class="c10 c8">Trading between Banano and Minebux creates a trading environment that helps Minebux have a determined price by the community.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10 c8"></span></p><p class="c3 c12"><span class="c8">To help with liquidity for the Minebux sale for Banano, a fee is taken to give Banano to those who provide liquidity to the liquidity pool.</span></p><p class="c3 c13"><span class="c24 c21 c8 c19"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5">6.3 Trading Terminal</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c10 c8">Trading is a big part of what makes Minebux adoptable as a currency for players. An ideology of making &ldquo;everything tradable&rdquo; is shared with the economics of steam.[2] Trading is the most important part of what makes the economic ecosystem viable for longevity. Making everyone that joins the ecosystem a significant part of it is important to integrating players. The trading terminal was purposefully named in a way for players to instantly understand what the terminal was used for and what it would do. The terminal was imagined as a homage to MMO games which have trading houses and trading halls. Minebux&rsquo;s overall naming scheme was created &nbsp;to help players instantly understand what individual components do.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c17 c8">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3 c12"><span class="c10 c16">Regional currency:</span></p><p class="c3 c12"><span class="c10 c8">The Exchange was created to trade one server currency for another. However, to help MMORPG specific servers have systems which allow for currency exchange of a central currency in their game and also have regional currencies which can fluctuate rapidly in price to emulate arbitrage opportunities within a server which would evidently ground the world more in reality and create a more immersive experience. Minebux employs Limited Fungible Tokens.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10 c8"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c16">Player to Player Trading:</span></p><p class="c3 c12"><span class="c10 c8">Non Fungible Tokens and Limited Fungible Tokens trading makes Minebux valuable to the target market and leads to players wanting to join the ecosystem. NFT to NFT trading is done over the website and is available ingame. Player to player trading is the lifeblood of the value proposition of Minebux. Even if every item doesn&rsquo;t directly feel as though players are making significant profit, players interact with the system in this way because of the value proposition distancing itself from being a &ldquo;play to earn&rdquo; system. Instead the value proposition of player to player trading and Minebux in general is player interaction, communication and relationships. Minebux&rsquo;s goal is to foster a community not built on making money on ingame items but making experiences. Player to player trading is a piece of Minebux and what makes it accessible to all players but also what makes it attractive to those same players. The problem with fighting &nbsp;the &ldquo;player to earn&rdquo; model. Trying to fight how some players want to experience Minebux is not in its best interest and is not the intention of Minebux design. However, it may lead to cutting out some players unable to experience Minebux as other players are accustomed to. In this way Minebux alienates new players from the ecosystem which discourages the other players and may lead to an increase in a negative influx of players. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10 c8"></span></p><p class="c3 c12"><span class="c8">However, trying to regulate &ldquo;play to earn&rdquo; players will lead to less adoption of Minebux by individuals that may want to experience Minebux in this way. To balance both camps Minebux encompasses both gripes and positions of players and creates artificial trances of leveled players. This type of player interaction is directly lifted from Team Fortress 2, with their separate community servers for unusual trading only. This player segregation is needed to have players trade in close proximity to wealth. We believe that players will not see the system behind the curtain as a value proposition of interacting with the Minebux trading system as the act of trading itself and not the worth of the items.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10 c8"></span></p><p class="c3 c12"><span class="c10 c16">Ingame NFT Trading:</span></p><p class="c3 c12"><span class="c10 c8">Ingame NFT trading is available for servers that are part of the ecosystem and have the Minebux plugin.
